The Kokkos Ecosystem provides a programming system designed for performance portability across all major HPC architectures.
At its core stands the Kokkos programming model, that combines data management and parallel execution capabilities to enable
writing performance portable software. On top of that the ecosystem provides higher level building blocks for scientific
and engineering software such as math libraries, communication interfaces and tools for debugging and profiling.

The Kokkos project is a Linux Foundation project and part of HPSF.
